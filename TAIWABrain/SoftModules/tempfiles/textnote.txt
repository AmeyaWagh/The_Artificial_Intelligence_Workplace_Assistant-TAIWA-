Dear SE, TE, and BE EXTC Students,

Greetings to you!

As you may be aware that Dr K. T. V. Reddy has joined as a Principal in one
of the colleges in south. However, he will be appointed as Adjunct
Professor for our Department.

From next week Monday onwards I will be available in the EXTC department
office from 8.45 to 9 am, 1 pm to 1.30 pm and 4.0 pm to 4.30 pm. For the
remaining time I will be available in the R&D lab (4th Floor, Diploma
side). If I am on leave you should contact Sadhana madam for the help.

My sincere request to each one of you is to perform the best in academics
and active participation in co-curricular and extra curricular activities.

If you have any issues related academics, personal problem, or any other
problem please meet me without any hesitation. We all are here to support
you in the best possible manner. Now onwards our emphasis will on
teaching-learning by you with enjoyment and because we force it on you.

Please ask your parents to come and attend PTI on coming Saturday without
fail.

Wish you all the best!

 Regards,
 Milind Shah
